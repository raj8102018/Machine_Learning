Text Classification with Multiple Preprocessing Techniques
Project Overview: Developed a text classification model using various preprocessing techniques and evaluated their impact on model performance. The project focused on comparing the effectiveness of raw text, NLTK preprocessed text, spaCy preprocessed text, and Gensim preprocessed text using TF-IDF vectorization.
Key Components:
1. Data Preprocessing:
o Raw Data: Used directly for TF-IDF vectorization.
o NLTK Preprocessing: Tokenized and cleaned text using NLTK libraries.
o spaCy Preprocessing: Applied spaCy’s tokenization and lemmatization.
o Gensim Preprocessing: Utilized Gensim's text processing tools.
2. Feature Engineering:
o Employed TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
o Classifier: Implemented a Logistic Regression model.
o Oversampling: Used SMOTE to address class imbalance in the training data.
o Evaluation Metrics: Calculated accuracy and generated classification reports.
4. Cross-Validation:
o Conducted K-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of different preprocessing methods.
o Results showed high accuracy across all methods, with mean accuracies ranging from 96.4% to 96.8%.
Results:
• Raw Data: Accuracy of 91%, demonstrating strong performance.
• NLTK Data: Accuracy of 92%, slightly outperforming other methods.
• spaCy Data: Accuracy of 86%, showing consistency with other methods but lower performance.
• Gensim Data: Accuracy of 86%, comparable to spaCy.
Skills Demonstrated:
• Text Preprocessing: Proficient in using NLTK, spaCy, and Gensim for text cleaning and tokenization.
• Feature Engineering: Experienced with TF-IDF vectorization and its application in text classification.
• Model Evaluation: Competent in using SMOTE for handling class imbalance and evaluating model performance using cross-validation.

Project Highlights:
• Successful comparison of different text preprocessing techniques.
• High accuracy across various methods, demonstrating effective model training and evaluation.
